# Financial-Risk-Measurement-Using-EVT-Approach-in-Indian-Stock-Exchange

- Conducted a comparative risk analysis of four major Indian banks (IDFC, ICICI, SBI, HDFC) over a 5-year period using daily returns.
- Estimated 95% Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) to quantify financial risks, using Peaks Over Threshold (POT) approach of Extreme Value Theory by fitting the Generalized Pareto Distribution.
- Assessed EVT model performance in modeling tail risks; identified HDFC as the most stable and ICICI as the riskiest under extreme market conditions.
